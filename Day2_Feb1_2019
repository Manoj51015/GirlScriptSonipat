<priyankasaggu119> That screen prompted to ask you
<priyankasaggu119> with what message you want to save your commit with.
<priyankasaggu119> Fine till now?

<priyankasaggu119> let's teach you how to use vim.
<priyankasaggu119> :)
<pankajpoply45_> tommorrow i will not be able to join . having clas
<pankajpoply45_> s
<priyankasaggu119> we will see that afterwards in channel, you type --> vim test.txt
<pankajpoply45_> pankajpoply45@LAPTOP-89A37RLA MINGW64 ~/testFolder (master) $ type vim test.txt vim is /usr/bin/vim bash: type: test.txt: not found
<priyankasaggu119> vi test.txt
<priyankasaggu119> try this
<pankajpoply45_> got vim opened
<priyankasaggu119> pankajpoply45_, that time also you wrote "type vim test.txt" instead of "vim test.txt"
<priyankasaggu119> Now press "i" to move into insert mode.
<priyankasaggu119> and add a new line.
<priyankasaggu119> whatever you wish like "this is new line"
<pankajpoply45_> done
<priyankasaggu119> now press "ESC"
<pankajpoply45_> done
<priyankasaggu119> and type --> ":x!"
<pankajpoply45_> now nothing is get typed
<priyankasaggu119> yeah, but see at the lower left corner.
<pankajpoply45_> done
<priyankasaggu119> you will see the commands being written
<priyankasaggu119> :x! will save the contents of your file and exit vim
<pankajpoply45_> ohk
<priyankasaggu119> open vim again by typing "vim test.txt"
<pankajpoply45_> opened test.txt
<priyankasaggu119> enter "i"
<priyankasaggu119> and write another line
<pankajpoply45_> done
<priyankasaggu119> press "ESC"
<pankajpoply45_> done
<priyankasaggu119> and type ":w" this will save the file only.
<pankajpoply45_> ohk
<priyankasaggu119> you will see something like ""test.txt" 4L, 57C written  " at the lower left corner
<priyankasaggu119> which says 4lines written
<pankajpoply45_> :x will do both save and exit vim
<priyankasaggu119> :x! not :x
<pankajpoply45_> yes
<priyankasaggu119> and ":wq" also
<pankajpoply45_> ohk
<priyankasaggu119> try ":wq" this time to close vim
<pankajpoply45_> done
<pankajpoply45_> will it save also
<pankajpoply45_> as :x!
<priyankasaggu119> yes "w" is for save/write and q is for quit
<pankajpoply45_> ohk
<priyankasaggu119> now, you type --> "git status"
<priyankasaggu119> and you will see this file as modified
<priyankasaggu119> and also not staged
<pankajpoply45_> yes
<priyankasaggu119> This means previous version, which we have commited is there as commit 1 and now we have made changes into our original file, so we have to again commit this and put it into our local repo as commit 2
<priyankasaggu119> understood? or have doubts?
<pankajpoply45_> understood
<priyankasaggu119> ohk. So, again type --> git add . 
<priyankasaggu119> I have written "." in place of test.txt
<priyankasaggu119> this time. This dot just signifies that I am trying to add all the files into my staging area. Since we have only 1, so, don;t make any difference
<priyankasaggu119> got it?
<pankajpoply45_> yes after this i have also committed and checked status
<priyankasaggu119> and now type --> git log
<priyankasaggu119> to see if you have another commit in the row.
<pankajpoply45_> only showing one commit
<priyankasaggu119> That means you havn't made another commit
<priyankasaggu119> type again. --> git commit -m "This is commit 2"
<pankajpoply45_> $ git commit -m "This is my second commit" [master 62cec59] This is my second commit  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
<pankajpoply45_> i had done that
<priyankasaggu119> That should have happend then.
<pankajpoply45_> let me try again
<priyankasaggu119> hey,
<priyankasaggu119> type "git log" and I will tell you how to read it
<priyankasaggu119> you are not able to differentiate the two commits i guess.
<pankajpoply45_> ohk
<priyankasaggu119> you wrote "git log"?
<pankajpoply45_> yes
<priyankasaggu119> https://pasteboard.co/HZa7rF8.png
<priyankasaggu119> see the screenshot
<priyankasaggu119> And check what I got as my last result.
<priyankasaggu119> you can see that?
<priyankasaggu119> you have something like that?
<pankajpoply45_> yes
<priyankasaggu119> ohk, you can see two different commit hash?
<priyankasaggu119> like in mine?
<priyankasaggu119> I have two like "commit 3db8b5d3f70999bdec5a106bb5aa295a58b07394 (HEAD -> master)
<priyankasaggu119> "
<priyankasaggu119> commit 9b7210763c92df8b90a6147f44c40a08ca785c77
<priyankasaggu119> each one of them is for different commits.
<pankajpoply45_> yes it is showing two
<pankajpoply45_> but message for one
<priyankasaggu119> and you can see "the two different messages also"
<priyankasaggu119> because you remember,
<priyankasaggu119> you havn't given any message for you first commit.
<priyankasaggu119> you lasted in opening vim only :p
<pankajpoply45_> but the seond message i gave was "This is my second commit"
<priyankasaggu119> and what you are getting?
<pankajpoply45_> this is my first commit.... i had given the commit message after cosing vim
<priyankasaggu119> Ah, I wish to see the screenshot. But you can't take one. Ohk just take a picture in your phone and send me on slack.
<priyankasaggu119> I am ending the session for today
<priyankasaggu119> with last note
<priyankasaggu119> that we are done till local repo.
<priyankasaggu119> In next session, we will push it to github that is from local repo to remote repo
<pankajpoply45_> got it . it is there . i was trying to see second commit message after first commit ..but it is before first commit
<priyankasaggu119> Homework:- You have to make your GitHub account.
<priyankasaggu119> And be on time in next class
<pankajpoply45_> have already
<priyankasaggu119> and revise all what we have done so far today.
